# GSRL_in_Pytorch
A pytorch implementation of GSRL (geometric-spectral reconstruction learning for multi-source open set classification using hyperspectral and lidar data)
I referenced [GSRL](https://github.com/vision-zhu/GSRL) which is an efficient implementation of GSRL's tensorflow.

To run the programme you need to install the limbr library

If you are on a linux platform run the command

```bash
pip install cpython
pip install limbr
```

If you are on a Windows platform run the command, I recommend you to use the offline installation.

If this helps you, be sure to give me a star!
